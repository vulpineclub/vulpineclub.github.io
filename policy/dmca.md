### Scope
This document is the required Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice for The Vulpine Club, a service of OwO Group LLC.

### Policy
DMCA reports about copyrighted works posted on [vulpine.club](https://vulpine.club/) may be reported using one of the following mechanisms:

1. The "Report" mechanism for a specific post;
2. An electronic mail to [dmca@owogroupllc.com](mailto:dmca@owogroupllc.com); *or*
3. Postal mail to: Designated Copyright Agent, OwO Group LLC, PO Box 18562, Rochester NY 14618-0562

In all cases, DMCA reports *must* include:

* A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;
* An identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;
* A description of the nature and exact location of the material that you claim to infringe your copyright, in sufficient detail to permit us to find and positively identify that material. For example we require a link to the specific post (not just the user's profile) that contains the material and a description of which specific portion of the post – an image, a link, the text, etc. your complaint refers to;
* Your name, address, telephone number and email address;
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**You may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that material or activity infringes on your copyright.**

**Your DMCA notice will be forwarded to the party that made the material available, and also may be sent to third parties such as [LumenDatabase.org](https://lumendatabase.org/). A note will also be placed on the site in question detailing the name of the copyright owner who submitted the takedown notice. In addition, you are required to consider the possible fair use implications, as a result of [Lenz v. Universal](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/important-win-fair-use-dancing-baby-lawsuit). We reserve the right to challenge abuses of the DMCA process, and your use of this process does not waive that right.**
